国内 设置源

Invalid depfile: /Users/bruceyan/code/ConfidenceApp/.dart_tool/flutter_build/1721412aa45e0711de53c701727164fe/kernel_snapshot.d
Invalid depfile: /Users/bruceyan/code/ConfidenceApp/.dart_tool/flutter_build/1721412aa45e0711de53c701727164fe/kernel_snapshot.d
Error: Could not resolve the package 'quiver' in 'package:quiver/strings.dart'.

解决方法：使用命令：
flutter pub cache repair
flutter clean

二
Flutter - 卡在 Running "flutter pub get" in xxx ，解决方案
//命令行输入
vim ~/.bash_profile

//添加下面三行，保存
export PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://pub.flutter-io.cn
export FLUTTER_STORAGE_BASE_URL=https://storage.flutter-io.cn
export PATH=/Users/bruceyan/code/flutter/bin:$PATH  //下载的flutterSDK的路径

//命令行输入
source ~/.bash_profile

flutter -h


检查包的配置
我们在项目的根目录执行以下命令，检测一下包的配置是否问题：

flutter packages pub publish --dry-run

如果没有问题，输出如下：

...

Package has 0 warnings.

发布包
发布包和上一步一样，只是少了 --dry-run 参数：

flutter packages pub publish

1.platform version错误，解决方法是修改项目里的ios/Podfile文件：
# Uncomment this line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'
platform :ios, '8.0' #增加的内容

post_install do |installer|
    installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
        target.build_configurations.each do |config|
            config.build_settings['IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET'] = '8.0'
        end
    end
end

flutter channel master

Warning: CocoaPods is installed but broken. Skipping pod install.
  You appear to have CocoaPods installed but it is not working.
  This can happen if the version of Ruby that CocoaPods was installed with is different from the one being used to invoke it.
  This can usually be fixed by re-installing CocoaPods. For more info, see https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/14293.
To re-install:
  sudo gem install cocoapods

brew install cocoapods
pod setup

Open ios/YourAppName.xcodeproj in Xcode
Right-click on Your App Name in the Project Navigator on the left, and click New File…
Create a single empty Swift file to the project (make sure that Your App Name target is selected when adding)
when Xcode asks, press Create Bridging Header and do not remove Swift file then. re-run your build.
This should fix the problem
